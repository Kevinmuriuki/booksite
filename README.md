# my favourite book
This code is a website underr a title of my favourite book.
I created the project as of the requirements of pirple.com to teach the world what I have learnt about web development.
The requirements are: 
1. Find a resource online that gives you a list of each HTML tag that you can use.
2. Pick 5 of those tags (5 that we have not covered so far).
3. Create a simple website about your favorite book / story, and include those 5 tags in the HTML. (The page can have any other tags as well, as long as those 5 are included). This can take any form. You can get as complicated or as simple as you wish.
4. Add comments to each section of your code, explaining the purpose of that block.

The code meets all these requirements.

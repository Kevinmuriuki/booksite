# booksite
Book site is a web page that I created for my favourite book "The leader who had no title". In the web page I have summarized the book and included a simple survey that includes some of the other books that the author have written and a textarea to send a message of how you feel about the website, although the form dosen't submit the info.

I created this to help me learn and teach people what I have learned from pirple.com, it is a practise in the course to create a project about once favourite story/book inorder to contineu.

Below are the requirements that one should meet in the project in order to proceed with the couse: 
1. Find a resource online that gives you a list of each HTML tag that you can use.
2. Pick 5 of those tags (5 that we have not covered so far).
3. Create a simple website about your favorite book / story, and include those 5 tags in the HTML. (The page can have any other tags as well, as long as those 5 are included). This can take any form. You can get as complicated or as simple as you wish.
4. Add comments to each section of your code, explaining the purpose of that block.

Also you are supposed to post your work, in my case a posted on twiter and in the assets folder is a screenshot of the tweet.

I used HTML5 and a litle bit of CSS3 for the code.
